Vapor Pressure of Water calculator Formula:
   P = 10^(A-B/(C+T))
Where:
   P: Vapor Pressure of Water
   T: Water Temperature, in Celsius
  A,B,C: Antoine Constants for Water. When water temperature in the range of 1 - 100 Celsius A=8.07131, B=1730.63, C= 233.426;
          when the temperature in the range of 99 - 374 degree Celsius, A=8.14019, B=1810.94 and C=244.485.

  CD = TH - SL - NE - AL - XH

    CD  = condenser duty; 
    TH  = total heat introduced into the plant, from fuel or other sources; 
    SL  = heat lost through the stack (exhaust); 
    NE  = net electrical generation; 
    AL  = heat lost to the air from plant equipment;
    XH  = heat exported from combined heat and power plants

  AL ~ TH*0.02

  XH = TH - EH

    EH = reported electric heat

FOR STEAM TURBINE:

  SL ~ TH*(1-BE)

    BE = Boiler Efficiency at 100% load (must be between 75-94%)
    
FOR COMBINED CYCLE:
  
  SL ~ TH*0.2
  
    NE = CA + CT
    
      CA = Combined Cycle, Steam Turbine
      CT = Combined Cycle, Combustion Turbine
      
For NUCLEAR:
  
  TH = NE/TE
  
    TE = Thermal Efficiency
    
For GEOTHERMAL:

  TH = NE/0.16
