2.1: k_lat = 1 - k_sens

2.2: W_evap*h = k_lat*Q_load

2.19: W_evap = k_evap*W_cond
2.20: k_lat = k_evap* h/(Cp*T_cond)

Leung:

2.21: Q_load + W_mu*h_mu = G*(h_a_out - h_a_in)
2.22: W_mu = W_evap = G(humidity_ratio_out - humidity_ratio_in)

G =  Dry air mass flow rate

Poppe:

Mass_transfer_flux = Kd*(sat_humidity_ratio - air_humidity_ratio)

Convection_Heat_Flux = K(Tw - Ta)

Lef = K/(Kd*Cp,a)

Me = Kd*A/W

Lef = Lewis Factor (0.5-1.3; 0.92 accurate)

Lef = 0.865^(2/3) * [ ((w_sw + d)/(w+d) - 1) / ln((w_sw + d)/(w+d)) ]

d = 0.622 (molecular wt of water/molecular wt of air)
w_ws = saturated humidity ratio
w = humidity ratio

For once-through cooling system:

klat = (1 + g/B + (4*e*s*T^3)/(h*f*B))^-1

g = psychrometric constant (pa/k) [function of atm pressure]
B = d vp/d T (constant)
e = emissivity of water surface (0.9)
s = stefan-boltzmann constant (5.67*10^-14 MJ/m2-s-K4)
T = water temperature
h = latent heat of vaporization (2.45 MJ/kg)
f = mass transfer coefficient

f = (1.0 + v)*10^-8

v = wind speed

Vapor Pressure of Water calculator Formula:
   P = 10^(A-B/(C+T))
Where:
   P: Vapor Pressure of Water
   T: Water Temperature, in Celsius
  A,B,C: Antoine Constants for Water. When water temperature in the range of 1 - 100 Celsius A=8.07131, B=1730.63, C= 233.426;
          when the temperature in the range of 99 - 374 degree Celsius, A=8.14019, B=1810.94 and C=244.485.

  CD = TH - SL - NE - AL - XH

    CD  = condenser duty; 
    TH  = total heat introduced into the plant, from fuel or other sources; 
    SL  = heat lost through the stack (exhaust); 
    NE  = net electrical generation; 
    AL  = heat lost to the air from plant equipment;
    XH  = heat exported from combined heat and power plants

  AL ~ TH*0.02

  XH = TH - EH

    EH = reported electric heat

FOR STEAM TURBINE:

  SL ~ TH*(1-BE)

    BE = Boiler Efficiency at 100% load (must be between 75-94%)
    
FOR COMBINED CYCLE:
  
  SL ~ TH*0.2
  
    NE = CA + CT
    
      CA = Combined Cycle, Steam Turbine
      CT = Combined Cycle, Combustion Turbine
      
For NUCLEAR:
  
  TH = NE/TE
  
    TE = Thermal Efficiency
    
For GEOTHERMAL:

  TH = NE/0.16
